# faust2superdirt.py
## faust2superdirt.py is conceived as addon for [faust2sc.py](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/faust2sc.py)
Enabling writing automation on SuperDirt core files and BootTidal.hs as we make the installation of the Faust Extensions on SuperCollider.



# WIP
Needed to be fixed : 
* Path locations for core-synths.scd ; core-modules.scd ; BootTidal.hs ; the .json generated by faust2sc.py 
  </br> only work in the same location for the moment
* Search the end of the 'address' keys in the json, to make the list of arguments (parameters list of the faustDSP)
* Maybe merging with the faust2sc.py as a -Tidal option ??
